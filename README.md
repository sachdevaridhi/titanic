Overview
This repository contains code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict survival on the Titanic. The model leverages passenger data such as age, sex, class, and ticket fare to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

Dataset
The model is trained on the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers who were aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

Files
titanic_model.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
titanic_data.csv: CSV file containing the Titanic dataset used for training and testing the model.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd titanic
Install the required libraries:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
Copy code
jupyter notebook titanic_model.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Model Training and Evaluation
Data Preprocessing: Explains how the data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for modeling.
Model Selection: Describes the model(s) chosen and why they were selected (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).
Performance Evaluation: Discusses how the model's performance was evaluated (metrics like accuracy, precision, recall) and any insights gained from the evaluation.
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test set, demonstrating its ability to predict survival accurately based on the provided features.
